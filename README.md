Creating Dashboards with Flexdashboard and Shiny

##### The R Flexdashboard library offers a wide range of templates for creating dashboards, coupled with other packages such as Plotly, ggplot2, Shiny, one can generate awesome dashboards with interactive features, dropdown menu's etc


##### The dashboard can be embedded as a shiny web app through Shiny rendering functions and uploaded to a cloud service.

##### You can decide to build a type that connects to a database and updates in real time, we call this a reactivePlot. Processes such as wrangling, preprocessing etc. can be automated. So it means there is no need for repeated processes, and updates can be made by adjusting a few lines to accomodate new pages. 

##### Cloudservices also offer methods of mailing dashboards to stakeholders at certain points in time. This Webapp was deployed to a shiny.io server and the results can be found [here](https://simmie.shinyapps.io/appr/#section-new-hires)
